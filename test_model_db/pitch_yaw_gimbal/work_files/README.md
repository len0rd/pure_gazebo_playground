# SVG -> Gazebo Model

Represents the top profile of the payload portion of the gimbal. I followed these instructions to make it a gazebo model:

Either gazebos import system or inkscapes save system is messed up, because to get this to render the correct size in
gazebo I needed to increase its diameter to 35cm (should be ~10cm).
